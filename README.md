# Docx-Consulting-AI-Agent

Consulting Report Reviewer is an AI-powered document review agent designed for high-stakes consulting deliverables, operating directly inside the ChatGPT app.

It ingests uploaded Microsoft Word reports and performs an in-depth review against predefined criteria—such as numerical consistency, adherence to a consulting style guide (e.g. accuracy and clarity), grammar, and spelling—then suggests improvements directly within the document using Track Changes or inline comments.

The agent integrates seamlessly with Word workflows while being accessible from within App ChatGPT, preserving the consultant's review process, accelerating quality control, and reducing manual effort on final deliverables.
